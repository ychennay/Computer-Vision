# Computer-Vision

## **Preprocessing** 
**opencv_preprocess.py** contains the class definition for an ImageModel. This ImageModel object is instantiated
for each image uploaded for training/testing purposes. It contains a variety of properties and methods relevant for the preprocessing
and feature exploration of the image, including grayscaling it, resizing it, conducting HOGs (histogram of gradients analysis), etc.

## **Classification**: 
**classification.py** contains the main script to run the training and test sets. The images are not uploaded here for 
proprietary reasons.
